This is a small tool that discovers people playing on the network using my emu and lets you launch your game with parameters that will connect you to their games.

This is necessary for some games (like stonehearth). It will also let you join games with lobbies that are not public.

Steam has something called rich presence (the connect key) that lets games tell your friends what command line parameters to run your game with to join their game.
Most steam games also let you join lobbies in game without having started the game by starting the game with +connect_lobby <lobby id>.

Just run this tool and follow the instructions then pick the exe of the game. Make sure that you have installed my emu on the game first and that it works or it won't work.
